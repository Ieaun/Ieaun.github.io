                <b>Description:</b><br>
                My MSc degree so far for trimester 1 has seen me progress my abilities with C# to the point where i am comfortable saying i have strong C# coding skills for a programmer at my stage in their development. <br>

                From covering the basics again and building a strong foundation to enhance principals in OO design and development, ensuring my system design skills adhere to outlined design patterns and practices, to client - server networking and many interesting concepts focusing on networking, network attacks and protocols (packet structures and flaws) in network security, to my favorite module Component based architecture where i was able to make use of all my abilities with C# and further them greatly by adding dynamic invocation methodologies using reflection as well as further experience with unit testing and using fake objects to my tool belt.

                                For the module Network security, i was able to learn about some advanced concepts in networking (protocols and their flaws, packet decoding, attacks, network configuration) and I was tasked with creating a packet sniffer to decoded all packets (UDP, TCP, ICMP, SNMP) traveling on a selected network (very similar to wire-shark). The project was also focused around development of an SNMP agent - SNMP manager relationship (Traps,MIB,...) and taught me a lot about network management and monitoring, the Asn.1 encoding and packet data-gram structure. <br>
                                The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ieaun/PostGrad-Projects/tree/master/Network%20Security">here</a>.
                                <br><br>
                                In my second piece of coursework for network security i was tasked with writing up a report on network protocol flaws. For this report i worked my way through all protocols used in VOIP and learned about some of the possible areas where each protocol can be penetrated and how to mitigate these possible vulnerabilities (IP/UDP/TCP/SIP/RTP/VOIP). The report had a heavily weighted presentation component to enable us to gain some valuable experience in presenting and explaining networking concepts to a non experienced audience which enabled me to develop further as a public speaker and improve my presentation skills.

                                This module enabled me to get off to a flying start in the first trimester, as i was already familiar with object oriented principals due to a first year module i took and due to being a demonstrator / teaching assistant for said module while completing this module i was lucky enough to be able to focus on other aspects of the course such as working on my knowledge of sql and databases / XML data structures while refreshing my knowledge of good OOP coding practices and features of c# that i wasnt already familiar with such as Lambda expressions and LINQ.<br><br>

                                The coursework allowed me to gain very valuable experience with databases by developing a student transcript / grading system. The system was almost entirely graded on design rather than functionality aligning with the OO nature of the module. I designed my system with a 3 layered approach in mind, keeping my data storage, business logic and UI separate and interchangeable and easily testable with inheritance, polymorphism, abstract methods and interfaces used appropriately.<br>

                                This comprehensive module covered the inner workings of the .net environment (in terms of performance, GC, memory management (stack vs heap), type system (boxing, type safety), CLI, CLR, Language interoperability) and compared its operations to those of its contemporaries (e.g JVM vs CLR).<br>
                                Further interesting topics include OO based approaches vs component based approaches, reflection and effective use of metadata alongside assemblies with security methods such as strong naming, versioning and signing of assemblies. 
                                <br><br>
                                I would label the coursework for this module as one of the most complicated i have completed at university as it had me using everything i had come to learn about C# to create a stack based simple virtual machine. My VM was able to interpret a given simple coding language (including conditionals and debugging features such as break points). The code also made use of app domains (The VM would run in one app domain and the executed program in a another) and lead to scenarios such as communication of objects between app domains using serialization, MarshalByRefObject and delegates. <br><br>

                                I found this piece of coursework to be my all time favorite while at university as it challenged me significantly in aspects i thought to be completely familiar with such as threading and interfaces. After completion of the coursework i felt i had a far better understanding of so many concepts and how to use them appropriately and it armed me the the ability to dynamically create instance of objects from separate assemblies using reflection which has proven to be a very powerful technique in other pieces of coursework.  <br><br>

                            My degree’s namesake module is one that brought with it many challenges that pushed me to produce better quality and far more efficient code. Due to the resource constraints of the development boards used in assessment (QL200 Pic16) only memory efficient approaches could be used to successfully complete the coursework assigned for this module. Within the coursework I was tasked with creating C drivers to interface with 5 different components and then make use of those components to create custom firmware for the board with climate control system features. <br>
                            Through over 100 hours of console-less debugging I feel I gained a considerable knack for troubleshooting errors without the need of an explicit arrow pointing at the error (although i'd never turn down access to breakpoints). The focus on efficiency also helped me greatly improve as a programmer and allowed me to get comfortable using pointers.

                            Within this course i was taken on a journey through different types of image capturing sensors, colour models (RGB,HSV,..), processing pipelines, and concepts used to process meaningful data out of images. <br>

                            For this coursework i was tasked with creating an image processing pipeline that was able to count the starfish in a given image which was quite challenging but taught me a lot about recognizing patterns in data, automating processes in a staged approach and the use of neural networks.  

                            I dipped slightly in quality for this modules coursework as it was conflicting with my dissertation. None the less the code for my image processing pipeline can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ieaun/Undergrad-Projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision">here</a> and my successful results are shown below.

                        <p>
                            Below is the abstract i submitted for my dissertation report:<br>
                            "Herein lies the background information and summarized findings of experiments, research and software development conducted to control the open source Crazyflie 2.0 drone (developed by Bitcraze) supported by a vision system (Vicon Tracker) which gives real time positional data that is processed through a regulated PID loop to produce torque values to alter the propeller speed of the drone. To allow users to interact with the
                            device and specify a setpoint/trajectory for the drone to travel to, the following needs to be implemented, a client must be designed and within networking means must be used to intercept positional data from the Vicon
                            server, this data must then be fed into a PID loop and transformed into a final value for propeller thrust. This
                            project has been conducted to offer some insight into the basic development of regulatory systems and object
                            tracking to give readers a foundation to build upon with their future work."<br>

                            This topic which lead to me being employed by the university under a research internship is one that i speak of very dearly and am enthusiastic about. I spent over 800+ hours on the topic learning about concepts such as quad copter flight dynamics, seemingly complex mathematics, open source libraries and knowledge gained from near to every module i had taken at university to complete the project. I relished the constant challenge of not knowing what the next issue would be until it appeared, and I enjoyed the work that was based around a system built upon open source software that had next to no previous implementations to meet my specific requirements. I know that regardless of the topic i will feel this way and enjoy my work as the parts of it that I enjoyed where in no way specific to the project but were entirely based around the constant challenges i faced which forced me to learn something new everyday.

                            <small>*it is worth noting that in my dissertation i focused on movement in a single dimension (Up and down), where as i was able to fully implement a system to control the drone in all 3 dimensions during my internship. <br>Traveling in 3 dimensions was far more complex as it required the use of the developed PID controller for each axis (thrust, pitch, yaw, roll) and brought along with it many other interesting physics based issues such as inertia</small>

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
