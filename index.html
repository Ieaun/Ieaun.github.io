                        <p>
                            My degree’s namesake module is one that brought with it many challenges that pushed me to produce better quality and far more efficient code. Due to the resource constraints of the development boards used in assessment (QL200 Pic16) only memory efficient approaches could be used to successfully complete the coursework assigned for this module. Within the coursework I was tasked with creating C drivers to interface with 5 different components and then make use of those components to create custom firmware for the board with climate control system features. <br>
                            Through over 100 hours of console-less debugging I feel I gained a considerable knack for troubleshooting errors without the need of an explicit arrow pointing at the error (although i'd never turn down access to breakpoints). The focus on efficiency also helped me greatly improve as a programmer and allowed me to get comfortable using pointers.

                        <p>
                            The theoretical side of this module was focused around mobile technologies with a heavy emphasis on mobile communication systems (2 way radio - 4th generation pure IP networking, bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, NFC) and their topologies as well as mobile device sensors / components, how exactly they work and how to make use of them.<br>

                            On the practical side of this course i was taught how to develop apps for android devices in Android studio using Java.

                        <p>
                            Within this course i was taken on a journey through different types of image capturing sensors, colour models (RGB,HSV,..), processing pipelines, and concepts used to process meaningful data out of images. <br>

                            For this coursework i was tasked with creating an image processing pipeline that was able to count the starfish in a given image which was quite challenging but taught me a lot about recognizing patterns in data, automating processes in a staged approach and the use of neural networks.  

                            I dipped slightly in quality for this modules coursework as it was conflicting with my dissertation. None the less the code for my image processing pipeline can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ieaun/Undergrad-Projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision">here</a> and my successful results are shown below.

                                For the module Network security, i was able to learn about some advanced concepts in networking (protocols and their flaws, packet decoding, attacks, network configuration) and I was tasked with creating a packet sniffer to decoded all packets (UDP, TCP, ICMP, SNMP) traveling on a selected network (very similar to wire-shark). The project was also focused around development of an SNMP agent - SNMP manager relationship (Traps,MIB,...) and taught me a lot about network management and monitoring, the Asn.1 encoding and packet data-gram structure. <br>
                                The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ieaun/PostGrad-Projects/tree/master/Network%20Security">here</a>.
                                <br><br>
                                In my second piece of coursework for network security i was tasked with writing up a report on network protocol flaws. For this report i worked my way through all protocols used in VOIP and learned about some of the possible areas where each protocol can be penetrated and how to mitigate these possible vulnerabilities (IP/UDP/TCP/SIP/RTP/VOIP). The report had a heavily weighted presentation component to enable us to gain some valuable experience in presenting and explaining networking concepts to a non experienced audience which enabled me to develop further as a public speaker and improve my presentation skills.

                                This module enabled me to get off to a flying start in the first trimester, as i was already familiar with object oriented principals due to a first year module i took and due to being a demonstrator / teaching assistant for said module while completing this module i was lucky enough to be able to focus on other aspects of the course such as working on my knowledge of sql and databases / XML data structures while refreshing my knowledge of good OOP coding practices and features of c# that i wasnt already familiar with such as Lambda expressions and LINQ.<br><br>

                                The coursework allowed me to gain very valuable experience with databases by developing a student transcript / grading system. The system was almost entirely graded on design rather than functionality aligning with the OO nature of the module. I designed my system with a 3 layered approach in mind, keeping my data storage, business logic and UI separate and interchangeable and easily testable with inheritance, polymorphism, abstract methods and interfaces used appropriately.<br>

                                This comprehensive module covered the inner workings of the .net environment (in terms of performance, GC, memory management (stack vs heap), type system (boxing, type safety), CLI, CLR, Language interoperability) and compared its operations to those of its contemporaries (e.g JVM vs CLR).<br>
                                Further interesting topics include OO based approaches vs component based approaches, reflection and effective use of metadata alongside assemblies with security methods such as strong naming, versioning and signing of assemblies. 
                                <br><br>
                                I would label the coursework for this module as one of the most complicated i have completed at university as it had me using everything i had come to learn about C# to create a stack based simple virtual machine. My VM was able to interpret a given simple coding language (including conditionals and debugging features such as break points). The code also made use of app domains (The VM would run in one app domain and the executed program in a another) and lead to scenarios such as communication of objects between app domains using serialization, MarshalByRefObject and delegates. <br><br>

                                I found this piece of coursework to be my all time favorite while at university as it challenged me significantly in aspects i thought to be completely familiar with such as threading and interfaces. After completion of the coursework i felt i had a far better understanding of so many concepts and how to use them appropriately and it armed me the the ability to dynamically create instance of objects from separate assemblies using reflection which has proven to be a very powerful technique in other pieces of coursework.  <br><br>

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
