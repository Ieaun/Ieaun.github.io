                    <h4>Brief summary</h4>

                    <b>Description:</b><br>
                    My MSc degree so far for trimester 1 has seen me progress my abilities with C# to the point where i am comfortable saying i have strong C# coding skills for a programmer at my stage in their development. <br>

                    Ive been able to cover the basics again and build a strong foundation to enhance my knowledge of principals in OO design and development and ensuring my system design skills adhere to outlined design patterns and practices. Ive gained further experience with client - server networking and many interesting concepts focusing on networking, network attacks and protocols (packet structures, flaws) in network security. Finally in my favorite module Component based architecture, i was able to make use of all my abilities with C# (interfaces, inheritances, threading, app domains) and further them greatly by adding dynamic invocation methodologies using reflection as well as additional experience with unit testing and using fake objects to my tool belt.
                    <br><br>

                    In trimester 2, i am currently learning about web development across the stack, from Asp.net and Entity framework to Javascript and Html. I am also learning about many security concepts related to access policies, identifying possible security flaws in code and cryptography.

                                    For the module Network security, i was able to learn about some advanced concepts in networking (protocols and their flaws, packet decoding, attacks, network configuration) and I was tasked with creating a packet sniffer to decoded all packets (UDP, TCP, ICMP, SNMP) traveling on a selected network (very similar to wire-shark). The project was also focused around development of an SNMP agent - SNMP manager relationship (Traps,MIB,...) and taught me a lot about network management and monitoring, the Asn.1 encoding and packet data-gram structure. <br>
                                    The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ieaun/PostGrad-Projects/tree/master/Network%20Security">here</a>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In my second piece of coursework for network security i was tasked with writing up a report on network protocol flaws. For this report i worked my way through all protocols used in VOIP and learned about some of the possible areas where each protocol can be penetrated and how to mitigate these possible vulnerabilities (IP/UDP/TCP/SIP/RTP/VOIP). The report had a heavily weighted presentation component to enable us to gain some valuable experience in presenting and explaining networking concepts to a non experienced audience which enabled me to develop further as a public speaker and improve my presentation skills.

                                    This module enabled me to get off to a flying start in the first trimester, as i was already familiar with object oriented principals due to a first year module i took and due to being a demonstrator / teaching assistant for said module while completing this module i was lucky enough to be able to focus on other aspects of the course such as working on my knowledge of sql and databases / XML data structures while refreshing my knowledge of good OOP coding practices and features of c# that i wasnt already familiar with such as Lambda expressions and LINQ.<br><br>

                                    The coursework allowed me to gain very valuable experience with databases by developing a student transcript / grading system. The system was almost entirely graded on design rather than functionality aligning with the OO nature of the module. I designed my system with a 3 layered approach in mind, keeping my data storage, business logic and UI separate and interchangeable and easily testable with inheritance, polymorphism, abstract methods and interfaces used appropriately.<br>

                                    This comprehensive module covered the inner workings of the .net environment (in terms of performance, GC, memory management (stack vs heap), type system (boxing, type safety), CLI, CLR, Language interoperability) and compared its operations to those of its contemporaries (e.g JVM vs CLR).<br>
                                    Further interesting topics include OO based approaches vs component based approaches, reflection and effective use of metadata alongside assemblies with security methods such as strong naming, versioning and signing of assemblies. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I would label the coursework for this module as one of the most complicated i have completed at university as it had me using everything i had come to learn about C# to create a stack based simple virtual machine. My VM was able to interpret a given simple coding language (including conditionals and debugging features such as break points). The code also made use of app domains (The VM would run in one app domain and the executed program in a another) and lead to scenarios such as communication of objects between app domains using serialization, MarshalByRefObject and delegates. <br><br>

                                    I found this piece of coursework to be my all time favorite while at university as it challenged me significantly in aspects i thought to be completely familiar with such as threading and interfaces. After completion of the coursework i felt i had a far better understanding of so many concepts and how to use them appropriately and it armed me the the ability to dynamically create instance of objects from separate assemblies using reflection which has proven to be a very powerful technique in other pieces of coursework.  <br><br>

                    <p>
                        My undergraduate degree allowed me to gain a lot of exposure to many different languages and techniques for solving an array of different problems in different domains.
                    </p>

                    Some of the types of systems ive developed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>An algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles using linked lists in C++.</li>
                        <li>An image processing pipeline to count starfish in different images in MATLAB.</li>
                        <li>Working with micro controllers and development boards in C / C++ to create a climate control system and a bugler alarm system using numerous components and sensors.</li>
                        <li>Client - server networking system in C#.</li>
                        <li>A robot movement simulation system utilizing neural networks/ machine learning to predict the direction of next step in Python.</li>
                        <li>A puzzle mobile app for android developed in android studio in Java.</li>
                        <li>For my dissertation, an automated system that was capable of controlling a drone to travel to a desired set point in a 3 dimensional space supported by a camera system.</li>
                        <li>And many more C# systems...</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>      
                        From primarily C# in my first year, i was able to build upon the programming knowledge i already had from high school. By choosing advanced programming modules in my first year i was shown a far more design oriented and structured side of programming while learning all of the basics. <br>
                        In my second year i was introduced to C++ in the module "Advanced programming" where i was exposed to data structures like linked lists and b trees and more complex methodologies. Through the modules "System design, analysis and processes", "Software engineering", "Networking and UI design" and "Agile software development" i was able to  continue developing in C# and experience many different group and solo projects all furthering my knowledge of the design process and the types of diagrams, methodologies and techniques (Networking, databases, SQL, XML) used to increase the effectiveness of communication and quality of deliverables in the software development life-cycle.
                        <br>
                        In my third year i was developing solely in C / C++ and Python and developed many complex and interesting systems all detailed below.

                                My degreeâs namesake module is one that brought with it many challenges that pushed me to produce better quality and far more efficient code. Due to the resource constraints of the development boards used in assessment (QL200 Pic16) only memory efficient approaches could be used to successfully complete the coursework assigned for this module. Within the coursework I was tasked with creating C drivers to interface with 5 different components and then make use of those components to create custom firmware for the board with climate control system features. <br>
                                Through over 100 hours of console-less debugging I feel I gained a considerable knack for troubleshooting errors without the need of an explicit arrow pointing at the error (although i'd never turn down access to breakpoints). The focus on efficiency also helped me greatly improve as a programmer and allowed me to get comfortable using pointers.

                                Within this course i was taken on a journey through different types of image capturing sensors, colour models (RGB,HSV,..), processing pipelines, and concepts used to process meaningful data out of images. <br>

                                For this coursework i was tasked with creating an image processing pipeline that was able to count the starfish in a given image which was quite challenging but taught me a lot about recognizing patterns in data, automating processes in a staged approach and the use of neural networks.  

                                I dipped slightly in quality for this modules coursework as it was conflicting with my dissertation. None the less the code for my image processing pipeline can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ieaun/Undergrad-Projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision">here</a> and my successful results are shown below.

                                "Herein lies the background information and summarized findings of experiments, research and software development conducted to control the open source Crazyflie 2.0 drone (developed by Bitcraze) supported by a vision system (Vicon Tracker) which gives real time positional data that is processed through a regulated PID loop to produce torque values to alter the propeller speed of the drone. To allow users to interact with the
                                device and specify a setpoint/trajectory for the drone to travel to, the following needs to be implemented, a client must be designed and within networking means must be used to intercept positional data from the Vicon
                                server, this data must then be fed into a PID loop and transformed into a final value for propeller thrust. This
                                project has been conducted to offer some insight into the basic development of regulatory systems and object

                                This topic which lead to me being employed by the university under a research internship is one that i speak of very dearly and am enthusiastic about. I spent over 800+ hours on the topic learning about concepts such as quad copter flight dynamics, seemingly complex mathematics, open source libraries and knowledge gained from near to every module i had taken at university to complete the project. I relished the constant challenge of not knowing what the next issue would be until it appeared, and I enjoyed the work that was based around a system built upon open source software that had next to no previous implementations to meet my specific requirements. I know that regardless of the topic i will feel this way and enjoy my work as the parts of it that I enjoyed where in no way specific to the project but were entirely based around the constant challenges i faced which forced me to learn something new everyday.

                                <small>*it is worth noting that in my dissertation i focused on movement in a single dimension (Up and down), where as i was able to fully implement a system to control the drone in all 3 dimensions during my internship. <br>Traveling in 3 dimensions was far more complex as it required the use of the developed PID controller for each axis (thrust, pitch, yaw, roll) and brought along with it many other interesting physics based issues such as inertia</small>

                        <p>
                            Engaging, assisting and supporting students within labs, identifying errors in created software, explanation of methodologies and their use cases.  
                        </p> Modules included:<br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Embedded systems software development (C, Assembly)</b> </li>
                            <p>
                                This third year module taught by my dissertation supervisor and mentor Dr Yongqiang Cheng was quite challenging. <br>
                                The course covered sections in both C and Assembler revolving around creating drivers for individual components which required me to have a thorough understanding of the course material to be able to implement methods / identify issues in both languages. This combined with a new component being introduced every week (Lcd, 4x4 key matrix, system clock, sensors,..) meant i would need to be familiar with the new component and all components before it to do my job well as some students would be up to 4 labs behind. <br><br>

                                Due to the small size of the class (+-20 students) i was able to provide personal 1-1 help in the 2 hour lab sessions and assist students when necessary.
                                <br><br>
                                This module and my experiences demonstrating / teaching for it taught me that i will not always know the answer to a question that is asked of me immediately, and thats okay! Sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to sit down and work at it for 10 - 15 minutes, none expects every questions you ask of them regarding code they've written to be answered in 2 sentences.
                                <br>
                                Along with that soft skill i also greatly improved my knowledge of C for embedded devices and abilities to read datasheets.     
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Class size:</b> +-20 (1 demonstrator (me), 2 hour sessions)
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <li><b>Programming and algorithmic thinking (C#)</b></li>
                            <p> This first year, first / second trimester module covered the absolute basics of C#     (Variables, Arrays, Conditionals, String manipulation, Lists, XML, Methods,...). <br>
                                In contrast to the above Embedded systems module, there was not a single question i could not solve / answer in under 5 minutes for this module as the course was in C# and i am very confident in my ability to code in C#. I also feel i could explain things very well in this module as i had a very clear understanding of how they worked at this point.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Class size:</b> +-100 (3 demonstrators, 2 hour sessions)
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <li><b>Object oriented programming and principals (C#)</b></li>
                            <p>
                                This first year, second trimester module covered slightly more advanced topics such as dictionaries, classes, interfaces, inheritance , access restrictions and general OO principals.<br>
                                I enjoyed teaching this module, as it was long enough to get to everyone if they were really struggling and students would ask me many questions as they were familiar and comfortable with me at this point as i taught them for "Programming and algorithmic thinking". <br>
                                Due to the amount of demonstrators i was also able to relax a little more while working, as if there was ever the odd question on "how do add your .vs file to the ignore list using tortoise svn" and i was wearing my "Sponsored by Github" hat, i could rely on one of the other demonstrators to quickly solve the issue and likewise could they trust me on many occasions. I found it a great team environment with each of us confident in the others abilities.
